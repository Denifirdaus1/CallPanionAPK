## Git Workflow & Branch Management

### Repository Structure
```
main branch          (Production-ready code)
â”œâ”€â”€ develop          (Integration branch for features)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/*        (Feature development branches)
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/*         (Emergency fixes for production)
```

### Branch Strategy

#### Main Branch (main)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready, stable code
- **Protection**: Never push directly, only merge via PR
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy to production

#### Develop Branch (develop)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for all features
- **Usage**: Merge completed features here for testing
- **Stability**: Should always be in working state

#### Feature Branches (feature/*)
- **Naming**: `feature/feature-name` or `feature/core-development`
- **Purpose**: Develop new features or major changes
- **Workflow**: Branch from develop, merge back to develop

#### Hotfix Branches (hotfix/*)
- **Naming**: `hotfix/emergency-fixes` or `hotfix/critical-bug`
- **Purpose**: Emergency fixes for production issues
- **Workflow**: Branch from main, merge to both main and develop

### Git Commands for Safe Development

#### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Work on your changes...
# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature implementation"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub to merge into develop
```

#### Safe Version Management
```bash
# Create a checkpoint before major changes
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Stable version before major changes"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Check commit history
git log --oneline

# Revert to previous commit if needed
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Restore specific file from previous commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file
```

#### Emergency Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make fix and test
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical production issue"

# Push and create PR to main
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-fix

# After merge to main, also merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git push origin develop
```

#### Backup & Recovery
```bash
# Create local backup branch
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Restore from backup
git checkout backup-20241217
git checkout -b restore-point

# Force push if needed (DANGER: only on your branches)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-branch
```

### GitHub Repository Setup
- **URL**: https://github.com/Denifirdaus1/CallPanionAPK.git
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Auto-merge**: Disabled for main branch
- **Required Reviews**: Recommended for main branch

### Version Control Best Practices

#### Commit Message Format
```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add ElevenLabs WebRTC integration"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve CallKit notification issues"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update integration guide"

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: improve API service error handling"
```

#### Recovery Commands
```bash
# If you made mistake and need to go back
git log --oneline                    # Find the good commit
git reset --hard <good-commit-hash>  # Reset to that commit
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>

# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard all uncommitted changes
git stash
# or
git checkout -- .
```

### Branch Protection Rules (Recommended GitHub Settings)

#### For main branch:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions

#### For develop branch:
- Require pull request reviews (can be less strict)
- Allow force pushes (for integration fixes)

### Project Backup Strategy
```bash
# Weekly full backup
git clone --mirror https://github.com/Denifirdaus1/CallPanionAPK.git backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or create release tags for major milestones
git tag -a release-v1.0 -m "Production release v1.0"
git push origin release-v1.0
```

# Supabase Functions (Terminal 3 - if developing locally)
cd callpanion-web/
supabase start                      # Start local Supabase
supabase functions serve            # Serve Edge Functions locally
```

#### Update from Lovable.dev (When needed)
```bash
# 1. Download latest web project export from Lovable.dev
# 2. Extract to callpanion-web/ (overwrite existing)
# 3. Commit changes
git add callpanion-web/
git commit -m "sync: update web project from Lovable.dev"

# 4. Test integration
npm run --prefix callpanion-web/ dev # Test web server
flutter run                         # Test Flutter integration
```

### Integration Testing Commands

#### Critical Integration Points Check
```bash
# Test Edge Functions connectivity (Flutter â†’ Backend)
curl -X POST "https://umjtepmdwfyfhdzbkyli.supabase.co/functions/v1/register-fcm-token" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Test WebView interface accessibility (Flutter WebView â†’ Web)
curl -I "https://your-domain.com/elderly/call?sessionId=test&platform=flutter"

# Test API payload compatibility
grep -r "CallData" lib/models/call_data.dart
grep -r "sessionId\|relativeName" callpanion-web/src/
```

#### Integration Health Check
```bash
# Complete integration validation
flutter analyze                     # Check Flutter code health
flutter test                       # Run Flutter tests
cd callpanion-web && npm run build # Test web build
cd callpanion-web && npm run lint  # Check web code quality
```

### Cross-Project Debugging

#### Debug Flutter + Web Integration
```bash
# Debug Flutter API calls to Edge Functions
flutter run --verbose              # Shows HTTP requests

# Debug WebView content (Chrome DevTools)
flutter run --debug                # Enable WebView debugging
# Open Chrome: chrome://inspect     # Debug WebView content

# Debug Edge Functions locally
cd callpanion-web/
supabase functions serve --debug   # Local functions at http://localhost:54321
```

#### Monitor Integration Files
```bash
# Critical files for Flutter integration:
ls callpanion-web/src/pages/elderly/call.tsx          # WebView interface
ls callpanion-web/supabase/functions/*/index.ts       # API endpoints
ls callpanion-web/src/services/api.js                 # API client
ls lib/utils/constants.dart                           # Flutter configuration
```

### Production Deployment (Integrated)

#### Deploy Web Project
```bash
cd callpanion-web/

# Deploy Supabase Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy web app (depends on hosting)
npm run build                       # Build for production
# Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/your hosting
```

#### Deploy Flutter APK
```bash
# Build with production web URLs
flutter build apk --release        # Android
flutter build ios --release        # iOS
```

#### Integration Deployment Checklist
```bash
# After web deployment, verify Flutter compatibility:
# âœ… Edge Function URLs match lib/utils/constants.dart
# âœ… WebView URLs accessible from mobile
# âœ… API payloads compatible between web and Flutter
# âœ… Database schema supports Flutter models
# âœ… Push notifications work end-to-end
# âœ… Device pairing flow functional
# âœ… Call interface loads in Flutter WebView
```

### Integration Troubleshooting

#### Common Integration Issues
```bash
# Issue: Flutter API calls fail
# Solution: Check Edge Function URLs
grep -r "supabaseUrl\|functions/v1" lib/utils/constants.dart
ls callpanion-web/supabase/functions/

# Issue: WebView doesn't load
# Solution: Test accessibility
curl -I "https://your-domain.com/elderly/call"
# Check CORS settings in web project

# Issue: Push notifications not working
# Solution: Verify FCM integration
ls android/app/google-services.json     # Must exist
ls ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist  # Must exist (iOS)
```

#### Integration Health Monitoring
```bash
# Daily integration check
./scripts/integration-health-check.sh  # Custom script for validation

# Manual verification
flutter run --debug                    # Test on device
curl -f https://your-domain.com/elderly/call  # WebView accessible
curl -f https://[project].supabase.co/functions/v1/register-fcm-token # API up
```
