## iOS App Store Readiness - Key Items Implemented

I've successfully implemented the most critical fixes for iOS App Store readiness:

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

**1. Production Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with production bundle ID (`uk.co.callpanion.app`)
- ‚úÖ Added environment-based server configuration (development vs production)
- ‚úÖ Improved app name from "callpanion" to "CallPanion"

**2. Account Management & Privacy**
- ‚úÖ Added age verification (18+) to signup flow with required checkbox
- ‚úÖ Created `AccountDeletionDialog` component with confirmation flow
- ‚úÖ Implemented `PrivacySettingsDialog` for in-app privacy controls
- ‚úÖ Created `ReportContentDialog` for content reporting mechanism

**3. Accessibility & UX**
- ‚úÖ Added `OfflineIndicator` component for network state handling
- ‚úÖ Enhanced permission timing - push notifications no longer auto-request
- ‚úÖ Added proper aria-labels to password visibility toggle
- ‚úÖ Added apple-touch-icon for iOS home screen

**4. Privacy Compliance**
- ‚úÖ Created iOS Privacy Manifest (`ios/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`)
- ‚úÖ Detailed data collection purposes and API usage reasons
- ‚úÖ Privacy contact email specified

**5. Backend Support**
- ‚úÖ Created edge functions for content reporting and account deletion
- ‚úÖ Added push notification infrastructure (ready for APNs integration)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations for privacy settings and content reports

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING ITEMS FOR STORE SUBMISSION**

**Manual Tasks Required:**
1. **App Icon**: Create proper 1024√ó1024 PNG app icon (current favicon isn't store-ready)
2. **Screenshots**: Generate iPhone 6.7" and iPad 13" screenshots
3. **APNs Setup**: Configure Apple Push Notification certificates in Xcode
4. **Testing**: Run Accessibility Inspector and test VoiceOver support
5. **Build & Sign**: Create production builds with proper provisioning profiles

**Code Improvements Needed:**
- Dynamic Type support (relative font sizing)
- Comprehensive VoiceOver labels across all components
- Focus management in modals
- Color contrast verification

### üì± **Next Steps for iOS Deployment**

1. Export to GitHub and set up Xcode project
2. Add proper app icon assets
3. Configure iOS entitlements and Info.plist
4. Set up APNs certificates
5. Test on device and create screenshots
6. Submit for App Store review

The app now meets the core App Store policy requirements and has significantly improved accessibility and privacy compliance!
