  'cron_heartbeat' as table_name,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'cron_heartbeat')
    THEN '‚úÖ Exists' ELSE '‚ùå Missing' END as status;

-- Check if new functions exist
SELECT
  routine_name,
  '‚úÖ Available' as status
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN ('rpc_find_schedules_to_queue', 'rpc_find_ready_notifications', 'cleanup_notification_queue')

-- 2. Check cron job status
SELECT 'üìÖ CRON JOB STATUS' as section;

SELECT * FROM cron_job_status;

-- 3. Test RPC functions

-- Test ready notifications (should show notifications ready for execution)
SELECT

-- 4. Check current notification queue
SELECT 'üìã NOTIFICATION QUEUE STATUS' as section;

SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MIN(scheduled_time) as earliest_schedule,
  MAX(scheduled_time) as latest_schedule
FROM notification_queue
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status;

-- 5. Check recent heartbeat activity
SELECT 'üíì RECENT HEARTBEAT ACTIVITY' as section;

SELECT
  job_name,

WHERE s.active = true
ORDER BY h.name, r.first_name;

-- 7. Check device pairings
SELECT 'üì± DEVICE PAIRINGS' as section;

SELECT
  h.name as household_name,
  r.first_name || ' ' || r.last_name as relative_name,
  dp.device_info->>'platform' as platform,

  CASE WHEN dp.device_info->>'voip_token' IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as has_voip,
  dp.claimed_at
FROM device_pairs dp
JOIN households h ON h.id = dp.household_id
JOIN relatives r ON r.id = dp.relative_id
WHERE dp.claimed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY h.name, r.first_name;

-- 8. Simulate a test schedule (for manual testing)
SELECT 'üîß TEST SIMULATION' as section;

-- This shows what would happen for a test schedule at current time + 6 minutes
WITH test_schedule AS (
  SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as schedule_id,
    (SELECT id FROM households LIMIT 1) as household_id,
    (SELECT id FROM relatives LIMIT 1) as relative_id,
    'evening' as slot_type,
    (NOW() + INTERVAL '6 minutes') as scheduled_time,
    'UTC' as timezone

SELECT
  'Test schedule would be queued at:' as description,
  (scheduled_time - INTERVAL '5 minutes')::timestamp as queue_time,
  'Test schedule would execute at:' as description2,
  scheduled_time::timestamp as execution_time
FROM test_schedule;

-- 9. Performance check
SELECT '‚ö° PERFORMANCE METRICS' as section;

SELECT
  'notification_queue' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_rows,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'queued' THEN 1 END) as queued,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'sent' THEN 1 END) as sent,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed
FROM notification_queue;

-- 10. Recent errors
SELECT '‚ùå RECENT ERRORS' as section;

SELECT
  relative_id,
  last_error,
  retry_count,
  updated_at
FROM notification_queue
WHERE last_error IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Instructions for manual testing
SELECT 'üìñ MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS' as section;

SELECT
  '1. Create a test schedule in the dashboard for 5-10 minutes from now' as step_1,
  '2. Watch the notification_queue table - entry should appear 5 min before schedule' as step_2,
  '3. Check cron_heartbeat for scheduler activity' as step_3,
  '4. Verify notification is sent at scheduled time' as step_4,
  '5. Check call_sessions and call_logs for created records' as step_5;
